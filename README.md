# React Native Vector Icons

Elevate your React Native applications with the power of customizable vector
icons. Ideal for embellishing buttons, logos, and navigation or tab bars, these
icons seamlessly integrate into your projects. Their versatility makes
extension and styling effortless.

For the integration of `.svg` files natively, you can explore [`react-native-vector-image`](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-image).

## Migration

See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) if you are migrating from `react-native-vector-icons` to the package-per-icon-set approach or between major versions.

## Installation

1. Install the packages for the icons you want use

   ```sh
   npm install --save @react-native-vector-icons/fontawesome6 @react-native-vector-icons/evil-icons
   ```

2. Depending on the platform you're targeting (iOS/Android/Windows), follow the appropriate setup instructions below.
3. If you are using one of the following fonts refer to their guides for further instructions

- [FontAwesome 6](packages/fontawesome6/README.md)
- [FontAwesome 6 Pro](packages/fontawesome6-pro/README.md)
- [FontAwesome 5](packages/fontawesome5/README.md)
- [FontAwesome 5 Pro](packages/fontawesome5-pro/README.md)
- [Fontello](packages/fontello/README.md)
- [Icomoon](packages/icomoon/README.md)

## Setup

Please refer to the guide for [Expo](./docs/SETUP-EXPO.md), [React Native](./docs/SETUP-REACT-NATIVE.md) or [Web](./docs/SETUP-WEB.md) for further instructions.

## `Icon` Component

You can either use one of the bundled icons above or roll your own custom font.

```js
import Icon from '@react-native-vector-icons/fontawesome';
const myIcon = <Icon name="rocket" size={30} color="#900" />;
```

### Props

Any [Text props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text.html#props) and the following:

| Prop        | Description                                                             | Default     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **`size`**  | Size of the icon, can also be passed as `fontSize` in the style object. | `12`        |
| **`name`**  | What icon to show, see Icon Explorer app or one of the links above.     | _None_      |
| **`color`** | Color of the icon.                                                      | _Inherited_ |

### Styling

Since `Icon` builds on top of the `Text` component, most [style properties](https://reactnative.dev/docs/style.html) will work as expected, you might find it useful to play around with these:

- `backgroundColor`
- `borderWidth`
- `borderColor`
- `borderRadius`
- `padding`
- `margin`
- `color`
- `fontSize`

By combining some of these you can create for example :

![type](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378279/7667570/33817554-fc0d-11e4-9ad7-4eb60139cfb7.png)

## Multi-Style Fonts

Some fonts today use multiple styles, FontAwesome 5 for example, which is supported by this library. The usage is pretty much the same as the standard `Icon` component:

```jsx
import Icon from '@react-native-vector-icons/fontawesome5';

const myIcon1 = <Icon name="comments" size={30} color="#900" />; // Defaults to solid
const myIcon2 = <Icon name="comments" size={30} color="#900" iconType="solid" />;
const myIcon3 = <Icon name="comments" size={30} color="#900" iconType="light" />; // Only in FA5 Pro
```

## Usage as PNG Image/Source Object

Convenient way to plug this in into other components that rely on bitmap images rather than scalable vector icons. Takes the arguments `name`, `size` and `color` as described above.

You need to install `@react-native-vector-icons/get-image` to use this feature.

```jsx
const source = Icon.getImageSourceSync('user', 20, 'red');
return <Image source={source} />;
);
```

Alternatively you may use the async method `Icon.getImageSource`.

Keep in mind that `Icon.getImageSourceSync` is blocking and might incur performance penalties. Subsequent calls will use cache however.

### Static methods

All static methods from `Icon` are supported by multi-styled fonts.

| Prop                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`getImageSource`**     | Returns a promise that resolving to the source of a bitmap version of the icon for use with `Image` component et al. Usage: `const source = await Icon.getImageSource(name, size, color)` |
| **`getImageSourceSync`** | Same as `getImageSource` but synchronous. Usage: `const source = Icon.getImageSourceSync(name, size, color)`                                                                              |

## Custom Fonts

The best approach is to use our icon generator to create your own icon package.

See [CREATE_FONT_PACKAGE.md](./docs/CREATE_FONT_PACKAGE.md) to learn how to create your own font packages.

You can also use `createIconSet()` directly in your project. This
returns your own custom font based on the `glyphMap` where the key is the icon
name and the value is either a UTF-8 character or it's character code.
`postScriptName` is the name of the postscript font. Open the font in <https://fontdrop.info/>,
Font Book.app or similar to learn the name. Also pass the `fontFileName` argument for Android support.

```js
import { createIconSet } from '@react-native-vector-icons/common';
const glyphMap = { 'icon-name': 1234, test: '∆' };

// use createIconSet() with object parameter
// or use positional parameters for compatibility with version <= 10: `createIconSet(glyphMap, fontFamily[, fontFile])`
const Icon = createIconSet(glyphMap, {
   postScriptName: 'FontName',
   fontFileName: 'font-name.ttf',
   fontSource: require('../fonts/font-name.ttf') // optional, for dynamic loading. Can also be a local file uri.
})
```

If you aren't using dynamic font loading you need to make sure your font is copied into your bundle.

## Animation

React Native comes with an amazing animation library called
[`Animated`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated.html). To use it with an
icon, simply create an animated component with this line: `const AnimatedIcon =
Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Icon)`. You can also use the higher level
animation library
[react-native-animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable).

## Dynamic icon font loading

> At the moment, dynamic loading is supported on native platforms (not on web) only if you use Expo. In the future, it should become available for all React Native projects via React Native core.

Fonts can be available in an app statically (since build time) or loaded dynamically at runtime. The latter can be useful e.g. for apps that use over-the-air updates and want to load new fonts with an update, or when you need to use a font from a remote location.

Dynamic loading in react-native-vector-icons is currently limited to those fonts that are bundled within the provided packages: it doesn't support Pro fonts (such as FontAwesome 5 Pro). However, loading of custom fonts is not difficult to implement: see any of the free font packages for reference.

By default, dynamic loading is enabled if supported by the version of Expo that you're using. It doesn't change the way you work with the package: If rendering an icon requires a font that is not known to the app, it will be loaded automatically and icon will render as expected.

`@react-native-vector-icons/common` exports several functions which you can use to control dynamic loading:

- `isDynamicLoadingEnabled`: Returns whether dynamic loading is enabled.
- `isDynamicLoadingSupported`: Returns whether dynamic loading is supported by your runtime (checks that necessary Expo features are present).
- `setDynamicLoadingEnabled`: Enables or disables dynamic loading.
- `setDynamicLoadingErrorCallback`: Sets a callback that is called (in the unlikely case) when an error occurs during dynamic loading. An example of when an error might happen is loading a misconfigured OTA update which doesn't include a necessary font file.

## Usage Examples

### Icon Explorer

Try the `IconExplorer` project in `Examples/IconExplorer` folder, there you can also search for any icon.

![Screenshot of IconExplorer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378279/8903470/a9fe6b46-3458-11e5-901f-98b7b676d0d3.png)

### Basic Example

```js
import Icon from '@react-native-vector-icons/ionicons';

function ExampleView(props) {
  return <Icon name="ios-person" size={30} color="#4F8EF7" />;
}
```

### Inline Icons

```js
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import Icon from '@react-native-vector-icons/ionicons';

function ExampleView(props) {
  return (
    <Text>
      Lorem <Icon name="ios-book" color="#4F8EF7" /> Ipsum
    </Text>
  );
}
```

## Testing

When running tests with `jest` you will need to mock out the native code loading to prevent errors.

In `jest.config.js` add

```js
// Mock out font loading
moduleNameMapper: {
  '\\.(ttf)$': '<rootDir>/__mocks__/file-mock.js',
}
```

Create `__mocks__/file-mock.js`:

```js
module.exports = {};
```

Create `__mocks__/@react-native-vector-icons/common.js`:

```js
// Mock the entire common library so there are no native module loading errors
module.exports = {
  createIconSet: () => "icon"
}
```
