# Setup guide for Expo Apps

> If you use React Native without Expo, please follow [this guide](./SETUP-REACT-NATIVE.md) instead. This guide applies to Expo apps only.

Icon packages from `@react-native-vector-icons` work out of the box with Expo, across all platforms. No additional configuration is required.

> [!WARNING]  
> Avoid Manual Font Duplication: do not add fonts from `node_modules/@react-native-vector-icons/some-font` to `expo-font` plugin configuration unless you have a specific advanced use case.
